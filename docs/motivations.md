# Motivations

As with any software system, Event Driven Architectures (EDAs) evolve over time. There is great utility from architectural, operational and security perspectives in identifying the events being used in an EDA and how they are being used. Having such knowledge would allow an architect to plan the future evolution of the EDA. From an operations perspective it allows the event infrastructure team to better understand current and future infrastructure requirements. From an auditing/security perspective it allows the identification of unexpected or even malicious uses of an eventing system.

In chapter 3 of the book [Flow Architectures](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/flow-architectures/9781492075882/), @jamesurquhart uses a Wardley Map to describe the evolution of various flow integration components, and places "discovery" in the "Genesis" phase. This project is an attempt to push forward the evolution of "discovery" in terms of mindshare, tooling and perhaps eventually, standardization.
